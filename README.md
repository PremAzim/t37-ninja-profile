# Ninja Profiles using React

In this assignment, I crated an improved version of a website using React to show all the tretton37 employee profiles.

The design is simple and minimallistic with a simple navigation bar facilitating all sroting and filteration feature of the page. The page also includes the main view which shows the ninja profile summaries of the employees.

The user is presented with all the profiles upon loading the page. User can then use one of the four available sort options to sort the profiles. User is also able use the filters to filter out the profiles based on their name or office location.

The design is modern, simple and minimallistic one with fine details on mouse over a profile. The simple navigation bar sticks always to the top of the viewport allowing the user to sort and/or filter according to their likning without having to reload/scroll to the top of the page. Users are able to redirect to contact links upon clicking on the respective contact icons.

The page is responsive and works on both mobile and tablets. The page also works fine in web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge & IE11.

## To run the project

From the root of the project, run the command:

```
npm install
```

This will install React and other relevant dependencies to the project. This may take a while. Once complete, run the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will serve the project to the localhost at port 3000 and launch a default browser tab. If the browser tab is not launched by default, the navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser of choice and the page should load.
